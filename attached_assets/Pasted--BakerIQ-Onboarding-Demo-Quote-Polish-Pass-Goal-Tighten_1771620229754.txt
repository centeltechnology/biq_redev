# BakerIQ – Onboarding & Demo Quote Polish Pass

## Goal
Tighten activation experience for creative (DM-driven) bakers.
Focus on emotional momentum, clarity, and reducing Stripe noise during early activation.

Do NOT modify Stripe integration logic.
Do NOT add new features beyond scope below.

# PART 1 – Onboarding Flow Improvements

## 1. Step 2 (Try a Quote) Behavior

After clicking "Create Demo Quote":

- Immediately generate the demo quote.
- Automatically display the preview inside Step 2.
- Highlight the "Send this quote to yourself" section.
- Do NOT allow “Continue” unless user:
    - Sends the demo quote
    - OR explicitly clicks a “Skip for now” link.

Add confirmation message after sending:
"🎉 This is what your customers will see when you send quotes."

Persist demo quote ID in onboarding state so it can be reused later.

---

## 2. Step 3 Copy Update

Replace first sentence with:
"This link replaces pricing back-and-forth in your DMs."

Keep Pro Tip box.

---

## 3. Activation Progress Logic

After onboarding completion:

- Set activation progress to 75%.
- Remaining step = Stripe only.
- Dashboard should NOT say 25% complete.

---

## 4. Stripe Noise Reduction

Hide top global Stripe banner for users who:
- Just completed onboarding
- Have not sent a real quote yet

Stripe should appear only inside:
- Activation checklist
- Get Paid step

Also hide Stripe banner on demo quote edit page during onboarding flow.

# PART 2 – Demo Quote Email Improvements

## 1. Greeting Adjustment

Replace:
"Hi Test Customer"

With:
"This is how your customer will receive their quote."

OR
"Here’s your custom quote preview 👇"

Remove “Test Customer” language from demo emails.

---

## 2. Demo Note Visibility

Reduce prominence of:
"This is a demo quote created during onboarding."

Move to:
- Smaller footer text
OR
- Subtle gray note below CTA

Do NOT let it interrupt professional appearance.

---

## 3. Email CTA Update

Change:
"View Full Quote & Payment Details"

To:
"Review & Approve Quote"

OR
"Review Your Custom Quote"

---

# PART 3 – External Quote Page Improvements

## 1. Emotional Framing

Replace:
"Ready to Respond?"

With:
"Ready to lock in your date?"

---

## 2. Accept Button Label

Change:
"Accept Quote"

To:
"Accept & Pay Deposit"

(If Stripe not connected, still allow label change but preserve existing behavior.)

---

## 3. After Accept (Demo Flow Only)

If demo quote is accepted:
- Show simulated success message:
  "Deposit would be collected here once payments are activated."
- Do NOT process real payment.
- Do NOT alter Stripe logic.
