You are the BakerIQ Replit Agent.

GOAL:
Refine the homepage to feel inevitable — structured, authoritative, and established.

Tone:
Calm.
Confident.
Professional.
No hype.
No fluff.
No “startup energy.”

Target:
Growth-oriented and established treat makers.

----------------------------------------
1) ADD SCREENSHOT ABOVE THE FOLD
----------------------------------------

Under the hero section, add a high-quality screenshot of the main baker dashboard.

Requirements:
- Use realistic demo data (not empty states).
- Stripe connected visible.
- Revenue snapshot visible.
- Clean UI clearly shown.

Layout:
Option A: Hero copy left, screenshot right (desktop).
Option B: Hero centered, screenshot immediately below.

Add small caption under screenshot:
“Your revenue. Your customers. Organized.”

----------------------------------------
2) ADD “HOW IT WORKS” SYSTEM SECTION
----------------------------------------

Add a clean 3-step visual section:

Title:
How It Works

Step 1:
Share Your Pricing Link
Customers build their order before messaging you.

Step 2:
Send a Clean Quote
Adjust pricing and send a professional quote in minutes.

Step 3:
Collect Deposits Automatically
Customers pay securely through Stripe. Money goes directly to your bank.

Keep this minimal, structured, and visually separated.

----------------------------------------
3) STRENGTHEN STRIPE AUTHORITY
----------------------------------------

In the Stripe section, add:

- Powered by Stripe Connect
- Bank-level encryption
- Funds go directly to your bank
- BakerIQ never holds your money

Keep tone factual.

----------------------------------------
4) ADD IDENTITY FILTERING LINE
----------------------------------------

Before pricing section, add:

“Serious bakers don’t run their business in DMs.”

Keep it subtle.
Not aggressive.

----------------------------------------
5) REINFORCE TARGET AUDIENCE
----------------------------------------

Add a small section:

Designed for:
• Custom cake artists
• Treat makers
• Home bakers ready to scale
• Established bakery operations

----------------------------------------
6) REMOVE ANY LANGUAGE THAT FEELS:
----------------------------------------

- Beginner-focused
- Side-hustle oriented
- Overly promotional
- Startup-y

Replace with confident, matter-of-fact tone.

----------------------------------------
DELIVERABLES:

- Files changed
- Screenshot placement confirmation
- Before/after hero comparison
- Confirmation tone now reflects:
  “Inevitable infrastructure”
