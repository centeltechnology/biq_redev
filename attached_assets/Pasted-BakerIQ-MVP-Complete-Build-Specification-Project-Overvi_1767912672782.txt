BakerIQ MVP - Complete Build Specification
Project Overview
BakerIQ is a lead capture and quote management tool for custom cake bakers. The MVP focuses on one core workflow: customers use a public pricing calculator to get cake estimates, which creates leads for bakers. Bakers review leads and manually create quotes when ready.

Philosophy: Keep it simple. No payment processing, no AI features, no marketplace - just lead capture and quoting that works.
