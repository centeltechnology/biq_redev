# BakerIQ – Premium Stripe Upgrade Flow (Single Path)

## Goal
Create a clean, premium-feeling Stripe upgrade path triggered only from the demo deposit simulation modal.

Do NOT modify Stripe integration logic.
Do NOT scatter Stripe upgrade CTAs across dashboard.

---

## PART 1 – Single Upgrade Path Rule

- Remove or suppress other Stripe activation banners/CTAs during onboarding + early activation.
- Stripe upgrade should be triggered primarily from:
  - Demo Deposit Simulation Modal
- Dashboard can show progress (75%) but should NOT aggressively push Stripe.

---

## PART 2 – Premium Deposit Simulation Modal

When:
- Demo quote is accepted
- Stripe NOT connected

Show modal:

Header:
🎉 Demo Deposit Secured

Deposit Summary Card:
- Deposit amount
- Message: "Would be deposited to your connected bank account."
- Label clearly: "Demo Mode"

Upgrade Section:
Badge: ⭐ Pro Feature
Headline: Unlock Automatic Deposits
Description:
"Stop chasing payments in your DMs. Let BakerIQ collect deposits automatically."

Primary CTA:
🔓 Unlock Automatic Deposits

Secondary:
Maybe Later

---

## PART 3 – Interstitial Before Stripe

When user clicks:
🔓 Unlock Automatic Deposits

Show interstitial screen:

Title:
Activate Automatic Deposits

Subtitle:
You’re about to complete a quick, secure setup with Stripe.

Bullets:
✅ Verify your identity  
✅ Connect your payout account  
✅ Start collecting deposits automatically  

Microcopy:
Usually takes 2–3 minutes. You can come back anytime.

Primary Button:
🔒 Continue to Secure Setup

Secondary:
Not right now

---

## PART 4 – Redirect Logic

- Only redirect to Stripe after user clicks "Continue to Secure Setup"
- If user closes interstitial, return to dashboard
- If Stripe already connected, skip upgrade path entirely

---

## Deliverables

- Files modified
- How Stripe connection state is checked
- Where upgrade path is triggered
- Confirmation no other Stripe CTAs are competing
