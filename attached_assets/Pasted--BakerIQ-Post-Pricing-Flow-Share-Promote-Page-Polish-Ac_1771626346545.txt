# BakerIQ – Post-Pricing Flow + Share & Promote Page Polish (Activation Focus)

## Goal
1) After Pricing Review is completed in onboarding, take the user to the Share & Promote page (launch moment), not the dashboard.
2) Rework the Share & Promote page so it feels like a “Launch Your Order Page” command center:
   - Make "Copy Link" the primary action
   - Reduce the Social Banner preview section significantly (it is currently far too large)
   - Push advanced/optional tools lower or behind collapsible sections
IMPORTANT: Do NOT change pricing logic, quote logic, or Stripe logic. This is flow routing + UI layout/content.

# PART A — Flow Change: After Pricing Review → Share & Promote

## Current (undesired)
Onboarding / setup completes → user lands on Dashboard.

## New (desired)
When user completes the "Review Pricing" step (pricing reviewed OR user clicks "Mark Pricing as Reviewed"):
→ redirect to Share & Promote page (Launch step)

### Requirements
- This redirect should happen ONLY once immediately after pricing review completion in the onboarding sequence.
- If user later revisits pricing page manually, do NOT redirect them away.
- Persist state so we don’t loop (e.g., `launch_share_seen = true` after first visit).

### UI (transition screen optional, minimal)
If there is a final onboarding screen after pricing, change primary CTA from:
"Go to Dashboard" → "Launch Your Order Page"
and route it to Share & Promote.

# PART B — Share & Promote Page Reframe (Copy + Layout)

## Rename / Reframe (copy only)
- Page title: "Launch Your Order Page" (or keep nav label but update page header)
- Change "Your Calculator Link" → "Your Order Page Link"
- Remove customer-facing use of the word “calculator” on this page.
- Supporting text:
  "Send customers here to request a custom quote and get an instant estimate."

# PART C — Make Copy Link the HERO action

At top of page:
- Primary button: "Copy Order Page Link"
- Secondary: "Preview"
- Keep QR code download but visually de-emphasize (secondary row)

Add short “Best places to add this link” bullets under the buttons:
- Instagram bio
- Facebook pinned post
- Link-in-bio tools
- DM auto-replies

When user clicks Copy:
- Show toast: "✔ Order Page Launched"
- Mark `order_page_launched = true` (used for micro-achievement / checklist completion)

# PART D — Fix the “Social Media Banners” section (too huge)

## Problem
The banner preview area is taking up excessive vertical space and feels like the main event.

## Change
- Shrink banner preview to a compact thumbnail card (max height ~160–220px on desktop; responsive on mobile).
- Put the action buttons next to/below it:
  - "Download Banner"
  - "Save as Profile Banner"
- Ensure the preview does not push key actions below the fold.

If needed:
- Move banner section BELOW the share caption/templates section.

# PART E — Reduce Noise: Collapse Advanced Tools

Create collapsible sections (accordion or simple “Show more”) for non-critical items:
1) “Caption Templates” (default OPEN, since it helps sharing)
2) “Social Media Banners” (default CLOSED or compact)
3) “Sharing Tips” (default CLOSED)
4) “Featured Items” (default CLOSED)

Priority order on page:
1) Order Page Link + Copy
2) Caption Templates + quick-use buttons
3) Share buttons (Facebook/IG copy/etc.)
4) Banners (compact)
5) Featured items (collapsed)
6) Tips (collapsed)

---

# PART F — Update Templates (remove “calculator” language)

Replace existing quick templates to be order/quote-request oriented, e.g.:

1) "Ready to order? Start your custom request here 👇"
2) "Get an instant estimate and request your custom quote here:"
3) "Custom cakes & treats made to order. Start your request here:"

Ensure templates insert the link reliably.

# Deliverables
- Implement the post-pricing redirect to Share & Promote (one-time).
- Restructure Share & Promote page layout per above.
- Confirm Social Media Banner preview is significantly smaller and no longer dominates the page.
- Provide a short summary of files modified and how you prevented redirect loops.
