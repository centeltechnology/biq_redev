# BakerIQ – Implement V2 Navigation (IA-first, no logic changes)

## Goal
Restructure the in-app navigation to match the core revenue workflow:
Dashboard → Requests → Quotes → Payments → Orders → (Setup) Pricing → Customers → Calendar → (Growth) Order Page → Refer

This task is NAV/IA ONLY:
- Update nav labels, ordering, and grouping
- Add missing nav item(s) if routes already exist
- Do NOT change business logic, Stripe logic, quote logic, pricing logic, or database schemas (unless absolutely required to add a nav link)

---

## Step 1 — Locate Navigation Source
Find where the sidebar/top-nav is defined (e.g., `nav.ts`, `sidebar.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, etc).
Identify:
- Current nav items and ordering
- Any gating/visibility rules (plan, role, feature flags)
- Active-route highlighting logic

---

## Step 2 — Discover Existing Routes
Scan route definitions (router config / pages directory) and confirm real paths for:
- Dashboard
- Leads/Requests
- Quotes
- Payments/Stripe
- Orders (if exists as a page/route)
- Pricing settings / calculator settings (should be a single “Pricing” nav entry)
- Customers
- Calendar
- Share & Promote page (rename to “Your Order Page”)
- Refer/Affiliate page (if exists)
- Settings
Also identify any admin/super-admin routes and keep them separate/conditional.

If a route does not exist, DO NOT create the feature. Only link to existing routes.

## Step 3 — Implement V2 Navigation Order + Labels

### CORE (Revenue Path)
1. Dashboard
2. Requests  (rename from Leads everywhere in nav UI)
3. Quotes
4. Payments
5. Orders  (add ONLY if an Orders route exists)

### SETUP
6. Pricing   (single entry that links to the main pricing configuration page)
7. Customers
8. Calendar

### GROW
9. Your Order Page (rename from Share & Promote; link to existing share page route)
10. Refer a Friend (link to existing affiliate/referral page; keep gating rules if required)

### ACCOUNT
11. Settings

### ADMIN (conditional)
- Super Admin / Admin tools remain separate and only visible to authorized roles.

---

## Step 4 — Naming / Copy Rules
- Replace customer-facing “Calculator” wording in nav labels with “Order Page” where appropriate.
- Replace “Leads” with “Requests” in nav labels (do not rename database tables).
- Keep internal code identifiers as-is if renaming would cause breakage; only adjust display labels.

---

## Step 5 — Pricing Navigation Unification (Nav only)
If there are multiple nav links related to pricing (e.g., “Price Calculator” and “Pricing”):
- Choose ONE nav item called “Pricing”
- Point it to the most appropriate pricing settings page (where toggles/sizes/flavors/add-ons live)
- Do NOT remove pages; just remove duplicates from nav.

---

## Step 6 — QA Checklist
After changes:
- Click every nav item to confirm route resolves
- Confirm active state highlighting works
- Confirm plan gating/role gating still behaves correctly
- Confirm mobile nav (if exists) mirrors the same order
- Confirm no dead links

---

## Deliverables
1) List of files changed
2) Screenshot(s) or short description of new nav structure
3) Confirmed routes used for each nav item
4) Notes on any routes that did NOT exist (and were therefore excluded)

## Hard Constraints
- No new features
- No schema changes (unless the app *requires* it purely for nav state)
- No Stripe flow changes
- No onboarding flow changes
