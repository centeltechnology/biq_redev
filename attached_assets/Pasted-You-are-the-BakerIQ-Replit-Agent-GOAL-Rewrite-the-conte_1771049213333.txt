You are the BakerIQ Replit Agent.

GOAL:
Rewrite the content on the /partners page (https://bakeriq.app/partners) to be more persuasive and aligned with a curated “Founding Partners” affiliate program, while keeping it clean, SaaS-minimal, and non-hype.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change the page layout/components unless needed to support the rewritten copy.
- Prefer editing ONLY the text/copy strings used on the page.
- Keep all existing functional elements: the 3 benefit cards, “How it Works”, “Who is this for?”, and the application form.
- Keep the current program rules intact:
  - 20% commission on subscription revenue only
  - for the first 3 months
  - 45-day cookie tracking
  - real-time dashboard tracking
  - application + approval required
- Ensure the page clearly separates:
  (1) Influencer Affiliate Program (commission-based) vs
  (2) Baker-to-baker referral program (free month / Quick Quote access)
- Tone: confident, straightforward, Gen-X direct, not cheesy.

COPY CHANGES TO MAKE:

1) HERO SECTION
Replace current headline/subheadline with stronger positioning:
- Headline should emphasize recurring income + helping bakers get paid professionally.
- Subheadline should connect the pain (DM pricing, chasing deposits) to BakerIQ’s solution (calculator → quote → invoice/payment).
Add a small “Founding Partners” line:
- “We’re onboarding a limited number of founding partners.”

Example direction (do not copy verbatim if you have better):
Headline: “Turn your baking audience into recurring income.”
Sub: “BakerIQ helps bakers price faster, send professional quotes, and get paid through Stripe. Share your link and earn on new subscriptions.”

Add 1 short “Earnings clarity” line beneath:
- A simple example, not hype:
  “Example: 25 Pro subscribers = ~$50/month commission for 3 months.” (Use accurate math and show it as an estimate.)
(Keep it short—one line.)

2) 3 BENEFIT CARDS
Keep the 3 cards but tighten the wording to be more benefit-driven:
- Card 1: Make the 20% for 3 months crystal clear in one sentence.
- Card 2: Emphasize “link in bio / video description / pinned comment” and 45-day cookie.
- Card 3: Emphasize visibility + trust: “track clicks, signups, commissions in real time.”

3) HOW IT WORKS
Keep the 4 steps (Apply → Get Approved → Share → Earn), but rewrite each step description to be more action-oriented and clearer:
- Mention “approved partners get a dashboard + custom link”
- Mention “earn on new paid subscriptions (Basic/Pro) for first 3 months”

4) WHO IS THIS FOR?
Keep the categories but rewrite the intro sentence so it feels curated:
- “Best fit for educators and creators whose audience asks about pricing, deposits, and business systems.”
Keep the list items, but slightly tighten each.

5) ADD A SHORT “WHY BAKERS LOVE IT” SECTION (small, optional)
If layout allows without redesign, add a short 3-bullet section between “How it Works” and “Who is this for?”:
- “Pricing calculator link they can share”
- “Professional quotes + deposits”
- “Invoices + payments through Stripe Connect”
(If adding a new section requires major layout work, skip it and instead weave these points into the hero/subhead.)

6) CLARIFY DIFFERENCE FROM BAKER REFERRALS (important)
Near the bottom (above or below the form), add a short note:
- “Already a BakerIQ user? Use your in-app referral link to earn free months / perks. This Partners program is for creators/educators earning commission.”

7) FORM MICROCOPY
Keep the form fields exactly the same, but improve the short helper text:
- Add one sentence that sets expectations:
  “We review applications within a few business days.”
- Add a sentence about what they should include:
  “Share your primary platform + audience size and how you plan to introduce BakerIQ.”

DELIVERABLE:
- Update the /partners page copy in the codebase (wherever that copy lives).
- Do not break any routes, styling, or form submission.
- Provide a summary of what files you changed and paste the final rewritten copy blocks for review.
