# BakerIQ Onboarding Email Sequence (7-Day)

Each email has one clear call-to-action. Stripe connection is reinforced as a P.S. in every email until connected. All emails should stay under 250 words.

## DAY 0 — Welcome + Outcome Framing

**Subject:** You just upgraded how you get paid.

Hi {{first_name}},

Welcome to BakerIQ. You now have a system that handles pricing, quotes, and payments — so you can stop doing it in DMs.

Here's what BakerIQ replaces:
- Pricing conversations in text messages
- Chasing deposits over Venmo or cash
- Sending quotes as screenshots or PDFs nobody responds to

The first thing to do: **connect Stripe** so you can accept deposits and payments directly through your quotes. It takes about 5 minutes.

**[Connect Stripe Now]**

Once Stripe is connected, every quote you send can collect a deposit automatically. No awkward follow-ups.

We'll walk you through the rest this week.

## DAY 1 — Pricing Efficiency

**Subject:** Stop quoting in text messages.

Hi {{first_name}},

Every time you price a cake in a DM, you're doing math that a system should handle for you.

BakerIQ's pricing calculator lets you set your prices once — by size, shape, flavor, frosting, and add-ons. Then your customers get an instant estimate without you typing a single message.

Today, set up your first product. Pick your most popular cake and add it to your calculator. It takes about 3 minutes.

**[Set Up Your First Product]**

Once it's live, you'll have a link you can share anywhere — Instagram bio, Facebook page, or directly to customers who ask "how much?"

P.S. Haven't connected Stripe yet? Do that first so you're ready to collect payments when quotes start going out. **[Connect Stripe]**

## DAY 2 — Professional Quotes Convert Better

**Subject:** A real quote gets a real deposit.

Hi {{first_name}},

Bakers who send structured quotes with clear line items and a deposit request get paid faster. Customers take you more seriously when you look like a business, not a text thread.

BakerIQ quotes include:
- Itemized pricing your customer can review
- A deposit request they can pay online
- A professional look that builds trust

Try it today. Send your first quote — even to yourself as a test. See what your customers will see.

**[Send Your First Quote]**

Once you see how clean it looks, you won't go back to screenshots.

P.S. Stripe not connected yet? Your quotes can't collect payment without it. **[Connect Stripe]**

## DAY 3 — Stripe Push

**Subject:** You can't get paid if Stripe isn't connected.

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick check: is your Stripe account connected?

Without it, your quotes are informational only. Customers can view them, but they can't pay you. That means you're still chasing deposits the old way.

Common hesitations:
- **"Is it safe?"** — Stripe handles billions in payments. Your data is encrypted and secure.
- **"Does it cost money?"** — There's no monthly fee for Stripe. Standard processing applies only when you get paid.
- **"Is it complicated?"** — It takes about 5 minutes. BakerIQ walks you through it.

**[Connect Stripe Now]**

Once connected, every quote you send becomes a payment link. Deposits land in your bank account automatically.

This is the single most important step in your setup.

## DAY 4 — Deposits Protect Your Time

**Subject:** No deposit? No commitment.

Hi {{first_name}},

If you've ever had a customer ghost after you spent hours on a design, you already know: no deposit means no commitment.

BakerIQ lets you require a deposit right inside your quote. You set the amount — flat fee or percentage — and the customer pays it when they accept. No awkward conversations. No chasing.

Today, create a quote with a deposit requirement. Pick a real or recent order and build it out.

**[Create a Quote with Deposit]**

Your time is worth protecting. A deposit does that before you ever pick up a spatula.

P.S. You need Stripe connected to collect deposits. If you haven't done that yet: **[Connect Stripe]**

## DAY 5 — What It Looks Like in Practice

**Subject:** What happens when a baker goes pro.

Hi {{first_name}},

Here's what a typical BakerIQ workflow looks like:

1. Customer clicks your pricing calculator link
2. They get an instant estimate and submit their details
3. You get a lead notification with everything they selected
4. You send a professional quote with a deposit request
5. Customer accepts and pays — deposit hits your bank

No DMs. No back-and-forth. No chasing.

That's the system working for you instead of you working for the system.

If you haven't sent a real quote to a customer yet, today is the day.

**[Send a Quote to a Customer]**

P.S. Stripe not connected? That's the missing piece. **[Connect Stripe]**

## DAY 6 — Make This Your New Normal

**Subject:** Make this your new normal.

Hi {{first_name}},

You have a pricing calculator, a quote system, and a payment tool. The only thing left is to use it consistently.

Here's how to make the switch:

**Share your calculator link publicly.** Add it to your Instagram bio, your Facebook page, or wherever customers find you. When someone asks "how much?", send the link instead of typing out prices.

**[Copy Your Calculator Link]**

Every inquiry that comes through your calculator becomes a lead you can convert into a quote — and a quote you can convert into a paid order.

Stop pricing in DMs. You have a better system now.
