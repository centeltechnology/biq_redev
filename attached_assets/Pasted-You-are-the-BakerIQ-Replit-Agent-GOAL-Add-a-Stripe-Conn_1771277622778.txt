You are the BakerIQ Replit Agent.

GOAL:
Add a “Stripe Connected → Behavior Activation” nudge that immediately tells new bakers what to do next (share calculator link + send a first quote), instead of stopping at “Stripe connected.”

CONTEXT:
We already have Stripe Connect and onboarding steps on the dashboard.
We also have share tools (copy link, QR code download, social templates).
We want to improve activation and LTV by changing user behavior post-Stripe.

-----------------------------------------
FEATURE: Post-Stripe Success Activation Modal
-----------------------------------------

TRIGGER:
When a baker completes Stripe Connect successfully (stripeConnectedAt is set OR Stripe redirect/callback success is detected),
show a one-time modal within the next page load/session.

RULES:
- Show ONLY to non-admin accounts.
- Show ONLY if stripeConnectedAt is set AND firstQuoteSentAt is NOT set (still not activated).
- Modal should appear once, then not repeat.
- Persist dismissal in localStorage (e.g., `bakeriq_stripe_activation_modal_seen=true`), but allow it to reappear if:
  - stripeConnectedAt was never set (shouldn’t happen) OR
  - we add a force flag later (not required now).

MODAL COPY (Calm + Direct):
Title: Payments Activated 🎉
Body:
“Now let’s put it to work.
Send your calculator link to anyone who asked about pricing recently.
Don’t reply with a number — reply with your link.
Then send your first quote and collect your first deposit.”

PRIMARY ACTION BUTTONS (in this order):
1) Copy Calculator Link (copies the baker’s public calculator URL)
2) Download QR Code (uses existing QR download feature)
3) Send Your First Quote (deep link to create customer/quote flow)

SECONDARY:
- “Not now” dismiss button.
- Small note: “Tip: Send your link to everyone who DM’d you about pricing in the last 30 days.”

-----------------------------------------
FEATURE: 7-Day “Activation Banner” if No Quote Yet
-----------------------------------------

After Stripe is connected:
If firstQuoteSentAt is still null, show a slim persistent banner (dismissible per session) across authenticated pages:

Text:
“Payments are ready. Send 1 quote to activate your system.”
Buttons:
- Send First Quote
- Copy Calculator Link

Rules:
- Banner disappears permanently once firstQuoteSentAt is set.
- Dismiss uses sessionStorage so it returns next visit until activated.

-----------------------------------------
TRACKING (Lightweight)
-----------------------------------------

Add a server endpoint to log “activation nudges” impressions (optional but preferred):
- /api/activation/nudges/log
Log once per day max per baker:
- stripeSuccessModalShown
- activationBannerShown
- actions clicked (copy link, download QR, send quote)

If tracking is too much for now, skip analytics but keep clean event hooks for later.

-----------------------------------------
DELIVERABLES
-----------------------------------------
- Files changed
- Confirmation modal triggers correctly after Stripe connect
- Confirmation it only shows when stripeConnectedAt set AND firstQuoteSentAt not set
- Confirmation CTA buttons work (copy link, QR download, route to quote flow)
- Confirmation banner persists until firstQuoteSentAt is set
- Test plan with 3 cases:
  1) New baker connects Stripe → sees modal → completes action
  2) Baker already sent a quote → should NOT see modal/banner
  3) Admin account → should NOT see modal/banner
