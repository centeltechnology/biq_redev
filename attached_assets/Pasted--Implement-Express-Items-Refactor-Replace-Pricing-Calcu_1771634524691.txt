# Implement Express Items Refactor (Replace Pricing Calculator)

## Goal
Replace the "Pricing Calculator" feature name and navigation with "Express Items" and properly integrate it into the Pricing section.

Do NOT change:
- Calculation logic
- Featured item rendering logic
- Order page logic
- Database schema (unless strictly required for gating enforcement)

---

## Step 1 — Locate Existing Pricing Calculator Route
Identify:
- Route path
- Component file
- Where featured items are stored in DB
- Plan gating logic

---

## Step 2 — Rename UI Labels
Replace all user-facing references:
- "Pricing Calculator"
- "Featured Items"
- "Fast Quote"

With:

"Express Items"

Ensure:
- Nav labels updated
- Page headers updated
- Button text updated
- Tooltips/help text updated

Do NOT rename database tables unless necessary.

## Step 3 — Integrate Into Pricing Page

### Preferred Approach:
Convert Express Items into a tab/section inside the existing Pricing page.

Pricing page structure:
- Tab 1: Base Pricing
- Tab 2: Express Items
- Tab 3: Saved Calculations (if applicable)

If tab integration is complex, acceptable fallback:
- Keep Express Items as its own route
- Add a prominent button inside Pricing:
  "Manage Express Items →"

## Step 4 — Update Plan Gating Logic

Free Plan:
- Max 1 active Express Item

Basic Plan:
- Max 5 active Express Items

Pro Plan:
- Unlimited Express Items

Enforce at:
- Creation attempt
- Activation toggle

If limit exceeded:
- Show upgrade prompt

---

## Step 5 — Update Helper Copy

Express Items page header:
"Create ready-to-request offers that appear at the top of your Order Page."

Add short helper text:
"Perfect for specials, bundles, and high-demand items."

## Step 6 — QA Checklist
- Confirm Free users can create only 1 active Express Item
- Confirm Basic/Pro limits enforced
- Confirm Express Items still appear at top of public Order Page
- Confirm quantity limits still work
- Confirm no references to "Pricing Calculator" remain in UI

## Deliverables
- Files changed
- Confirmed route integration
- Confirmed gating enforcement logic
- Any legacy references found and updated
