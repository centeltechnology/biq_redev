# BakerIQ – Processing-First Plan Updates (Unlimited Quotes + Express Item Limits)

## Goal
Switch the platform to a processing-first model:
- Remove quote limits for all plans (especially Free)
- Enforce Express Items limits by plan
- Update UI copy to match the new plan rules

Do NOT change Stripe onboarding flow.
Do NOT change payment logic.
Do NOT change database schema unless needed to enforce limits reliably.

## Step 1 — Remove Quote Limits (All Plans)
Find where quote limits are enforced (backend and/or frontend).
Examples to look for:
- `MAX_QUOTES`, `quoteLimit`, `remainingQuotes`, `monthlyQuotes`, etc.
- checks in quote creation endpoints, middleware, or UI guards
- “0/15 quotes” counters in UI (top bar)

Required outcome:
- Free, Basic, Pro all have **unlimited quotes**
- If there is a UI “quotes remaining” indicator, either:
  A) Remove it, OR
  B) Replace it with something meaningful (e.g., “Quotes sent this month”) without blocking

## Step 2 — Express Items Limits by Plan (Enforced)
Express Items (currently surfaced via "Price Calculator") must be limited like this:

### Limits
- Free: max **1 active** Express Item
- Basic: max **5 active** Express Items
- Pro: **unlimited active** Express Items

### Enforce at:
- Create Express Item
- Activate/feature toggle (if items can be saved inactive)

Rules:
- If user tries to create/activate beyond their limit:
  - Prevent action
  - Show upgrade modal/message (Basic/Pro upsell)
- Do not rely only on UI hiding; enforce in server/API layer too.

## Step 3 — Update Pricing Plan Copy (UI)
Update pricing page and any plan summaries so they match:

### Free
- Unlimited quotes
- 1 Express Item
- 7% platform fee

### Basic
- Unlimited quotes
- Up to 5 Express Items
- 5% platform fee

### Pro
- Unlimited quotes
- Unlimited Express Items
- 3% platform fee

Also update any labels that currently say:
- “Featured Items” (if you’re standardizing on Express Items)
- “15 quotes/month” or similar

---

## Step 4 — UI/Copy Cleanup Pass
Search the codebase for outdated references:
- “15 quotes”
- “5 quotes”
- “quote limit”
- “Pricing Calculator” (ONLY change copy where it refers to Express Items; keep internal route names if changing would break things)

Update tooltips + helper copy where relevant:
- Express Items: “Ready-to-request offers that appear at the top of your Order Page.”

## Step 5 — QA Checklist
Create a short test checklist and confirm:

### Quotes
- Free user can create quotes repeatedly (no cap)
- Basic user same
- Pro user same

### Express Items
- Free can have 1 active Express Item, blocked at 2
- Basic can have up to 5 active, blocked at 6
- Pro unlimited

### Copy
- Pricing page matches new rules
- Any “quotes remaining” blocker is removed

## Deliverables
1) List of files changed
2) Where quote limits were enforced (and how you removed them)
3) Where Express Item limits are enforced (API + UI)
4) Screenshots or brief summary of updated pricing copy
