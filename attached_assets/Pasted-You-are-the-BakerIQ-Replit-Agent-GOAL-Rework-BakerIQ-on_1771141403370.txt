You are the BakerIQ Replit Agent.

GOAL:
Rework BakerIQ onboarding to be action-driven (activation-focused) instead of informational. The objective is to increase early activation by guiding new bakers to complete “Stripe → First Quote → (Optional) Share Calculator Link” in their first session.

PRIMARY KPI:
- Increase % of new signups who send a first quote within 48 hours
- Secondary: increase % who process first payment within 30 days

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT add new major features.
- Reuse existing screens/components and Stripe Connect flow.
- Keep the current inbound-lead model (calculator link) intact.
- This is a UX + onboarding flow refactor: checklist, routing, copy, and lightweight helper UI only.
- Soft-gate only. No hard lockouts unless already required for payments.
- Admin accounts must be excluded from onboarding prompts.

WHAT TO CHANGE:

1) Replace “Tour/Modal Walkthrough” With an “Action Checklist”
Current state: onboarding modal explains the system.
New state: show a simple “Start Here” checklist widget at the top of the dashboard for bakers who have not completed key activation steps.

Checklist items (in this order):
✅ Step 1: Connect Stripe (required to get paid)
✅ Step 2: Send your first quote (fast first win)
✅ Step 3: Share your calculator link (inbound growth)

Rules:
- The checklist shows for new / unactivated bakers until steps are completed.
- If stripeConnectedAt is null, Step 1 is highlighted with primary CTA “Connect Stripe”.
- Once Stripe is connected, Step 2 becomes highlighted with primary CTA “Send your first quote”.
- Step 3 is shown but not emphasized until Step 2 is completed.

2) “Send First Quote” Guided Shortcut (No New Feature)
When user clicks “Send your first quote” from the checklist:
- Route them directly to the existing quote creation flow (or the closest equivalent).
- If the flow requires a customer first, open the existing “Add Customer” modal inline, then return them to quote creation.
- Pre-fill any optional fields if easy (e.g., “Test Customer” and their own email as recipient) BUT keep it optional.
- Provide an explicit option: “Send test quote to myself” (if trivial) OR “Send to customer”.
  - If adding “send to myself” is too invasive, just prefill their email in recipient field and label it as optional.

Success feedback:
- After sending first quote, show a toast:
  “Nice — your first quote is sent. Next: share your calculator link to get inbound requests.”

3) Re-sequence Dashboard Nudges
Current: top banner emphasizes sharing calculator link.
Change:
- If Stripe NOT connected: primary banner emphasizes Stripe connect.
- Else if Stripe connected AND firstQuoteSentAt is null: primary banner emphasizes “Send your first quote”.
- Else: show “Share your calculator link” banner.
This ensures the first thing they see matches the next best action.

4) Update Onboarding Emails (Sequencing Only)
Do NOT rewrite the entire series again.
Just adjust Day 0–2 emphasis to mirror action order:
- If Stripe not connected: connect Stripe CTA is primary.
- If Stripe connected but no first quote: “send first quote today” CTA.
- Only after quote is sent: “share calculator link” CTA.

5) Tracking / Analytics (Lightweight)
Add or reuse activation timestamps:
- stripeConnectedAt already exists
- firstQuoteSentAt already exists
Ensure firstQuoteSentAt is set when a quote is actually sent.

Add 2 simple tracking flags (optional but preferred):
- onboardingChecklistSeenAt (timestamp) OR log an event
- firstQuoteCTAUsedAt (timestamp) OR log an event

These should be low-effort and help validate whether the checklist is driving behavior.

DELIVERABLES:
- Files changed list
- Updated dashboard UI showing the “Start Here” checklist
- Updated banner sequencing logic
- Updated minimal email sequencing logic
- Test plan:
  1) New baker, no Stripe → sees checklist + Stripe CTA
  2) After Stripe connect → checklist highlights “Send first quote”
  3) After sending quote → checklist highlights “Share calculator”
  4) Returning unactivated users see the correct next step
  5) Admin accounts do not see onboarding UI
