You are the BakerIQ Replit Agent.

GOAL:
Refine the dashboard onboarding experience to drive activation and add a frictionless “Send Test Quote to Myself” path.

PRIMARY KPI:
Increase % of new users who send their first quote within 48 hours.

-----------------------------------------
PART 1 — DASHBOARD ACTIVATION REFINEMENT
-----------------------------------------

1) Replace “Start Here” with:
   Headline: “Let’s Get You Paid”

2) When onboarding checklist is visible (stripeConnectedAt is NULL OR firstQuoteSentAt is NULL):

- De-emphasize revenue widgets.
  Option:
    Replace with placeholder card:
    “Your revenue metrics will appear after your first quote is sent.”

3) Checklist Order (must remain):

   1. Connect Stripe
   2. Send your first quote
   3. Share your calculator link

4) Step Behavior:

- Step 1:
  Copy change to:
  “Connect Stripe to start getting paid.”

- After Stripe connects:
  - Remove Stripe banner
  - Mark Step 1 complete
  - Highlight Step 2
  - Show toast:
    “Stripe connected — you’re ready to send your first quote.”

- Step 2 must include a visible CTA button:
  [ Send First Quote → ]

-----------------------------------------
PART 2 — SEND TEST QUOTE ACTIVATION PATH
-----------------------------------------

When user clicks “Send First Quote” from checklist:

Show small modal:

Title:
“Send your first quote”

Body:
“Would you like to send a real quote to a customer, or test the system first?”

Options:
○ Send to a real customer
○ Send a test quote to myself

-----------------------------------------

If “Send a test quote to myself” selected:

- Auto-create customer:
   Name: User display name
   Email: User account email
   (Prefix name with “Test – ” if helpful)

- Auto-create basic quote draft:
   Description: “Sample Cake Order”
   Price: $100 (editable)

- Route to quote preview screen.

-----------------------------------------

When test quote is sent:

- Use normal send logic.
- Deliver real email.
- Include real Stripe checkout link.
- Set firstQuoteSentAt if not already set.
- Advance checklist to Step 3.
- Show toast:
  “Your first quote has been sent. Check your email to see how customers will receive it.”

-----------------------------------------

GUARDRAILS

- Only show this flow if:
   stripeConnectedAt is NOT NULL
   AND firstQuoteSentAt is NULL
- Admin accounts excluded.
- Existing Create Quote flow remains unchanged.

-----------------------------------------

DELIVERABLES:

- Files changed
- Confirmation checklist logic works
- Confirmation Stripe unlock transition works
- Confirmation test quote sends properly
- Test plan covering:
   New baker → Connect Stripe → Send test quote → Checklist advances
