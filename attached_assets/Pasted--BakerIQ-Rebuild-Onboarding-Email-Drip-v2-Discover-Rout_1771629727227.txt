# BakerIQ – Rebuild Onboarding Email Drip v2 (Discover Routes + Update Templates)

## Goal
Update the onboarding email sequence (Days 0–6) to match the NEW activation-first product flow:
Setup → Pricing Ownership → Launch Order Page → Get Requests → Convert to Quote → Payments as Upgrade.

IMPORTANT:
- Discover the correct in-app routes from the codebase and use those links in the email templates.
- Do NOT change Stripe/payment logic, quote logic, or onboarding UI logic.
- Only update onboarding/drip templates + documentation.

---

## Step 1 — Discover Routes (from codebase)
Search the codebase for the real paths/URLs for:
1) Onboarding page route (e.g., `/onboarding`)
2) Pricing settings route (calculator settings / pricing config)
3) Share & Promote route (launch/order page link sharing)
4) Quotes list/new route (quotes workspace)
5) Leads/Requests route (where customer requests land)
6) Payments/Stripe connect entry route (where user starts the secure setup)

Notes:
- Prefer internal app URLs that the logged-in user can access.
- If email links require absolute URLs, use the existing base URL/config used elsewhere in email templates.
- If there are multiple environments, follow current pattern used in existing emails (e.g., `APP_URL` / `PUBLIC_URL` env).

---

## Step 2 — Create Documentation File
Create a new markdown file:
`/docs/email_sequences_v2.md`

Include:
- Email name (Day 0–Day 6)
- Trigger (when it sends)
- Recipient (baker)
- Subject
- Full body
- The routes found and inserted (list at top)
- Any assumptions

---

## Step 3 — Update the Actual Email Templates
Locate where onboarding drip emails are defined (e.g., `/emails`, `/templates`, `sendy`, `resend`, `nodemailer`, etc.).
Update ONLY the onboarding drip emails for Days 0–6 to match the copy below.

Do not touch transactional emails (quote sent, inquiry received, payment receipt, etc.).

Where the system supports segmentation/branching:
- Use a Stripe Connected vs Not Connected variant for Day 4 (if supported).
- If branching isn’t supported today, implement a single Day 4 that frames payments as optional upgrade and links to the payments entry route.

## Email Copy (v2)

### Day 0 — Welcome (Activation first)
Subject: "Your order page is getting set up"
Body:
Hi {{businessName}},
Welcome to BakerIQ — this is your new system for turning DM inquiries into professional quotes (without the back-and-forth).

Here’s the move: finish setup and launch your order page.

In a few minutes you’ll have:
- A public order page customers can use for instant estimates
- A clean request that hits your dashboard (no messy DMs)
- A professional quote you can send in one click

Start here:
Finish Setup → {{ONBOARDING_URL}}

You’ll see payments later — but first, let’s get you live.

---

### Day 1 — Pricing ownership
Subject: "We set the foundation — you set the standard"
Body:
Hi {{businessName}},
Your order page comes with pricing and offerings preloaded as a starting point.

Now make it yours. Take 3 minutes to review:
- Sizes & tiers
- Flavors & frosting options
- Decorations + add-ons

Review your pricing here:
{{PRICING_URL}}

Once pricing looks right, you’re ready to launch your link.

---

### Day 2 — Launch your order page
Subject: "Put this link in your bio today"
Body:
Hi {{businessName}},
Your order page is the whole game.

When someone asks “how much?” you don’t explain pricing — you send the link.

Best places to add it:
- Instagram bio
- Facebook pinned post
- Link-in-bio tools
- DM auto-replies

Launch your order page here:
{{SHARE_URL}}

---

### Day 3 — Get your first request (route DMs)
Subject: "Stop typing prices — route them here"
Body:
Hi {{businessName}},
Today’s goal is simple: get ONE real inquiry through your order page.

Next time someone messages you:
1) Reply with your link
2) Let them build their request + get an estimate
3) You receive the full details (no guessing)

Copy your order page link here:
{{SHARE_URL}}

---

### Day 4 — Deposits as an upgrade (Stripe)

#### If Stripe connected (preferred variant)
Subject: "You’re ready to collect deposits automatically"
Body:
Hi {{businessName}},
You’re connected — that means when a customer accepts your quote, the deposit can be collected automatically.

Next time a request comes in:
- Open the request
- Convert to a quote
- Send the quote with a deposit option

Go to quotes:
{{QUOTES_URL}}

This is the part where you stop chasing money in DMs.

#### If Stripe NOT connected (preferred variant)
Subject: "Want deposits to collect automatically?"
Body:
Hi {{businessName}},
You can run BakerIQ without payments… but the upgrade is automatic deposits.

When payments are enabled:
- Customers can accept quotes and pay deposits online
- No awkward follow-ups
- No “did you send it?” messages

Enable automatic deposits here:
{{PAYMENTS_URL}}

No rush — but once you’re getting real requests, this saves time fast.

#### If system can’t branch today
Use the NOT connected version but keep tone “optional upgrade”.

### Day 5 — Full workflow reinforcement
Subject: "Here’s the full BakerIQ flow (the simple version)"
Body:
Hi {{businessName}},
Here’s the clean workflow:
1) Customer uses your order page
2) You receive a detailed request
3) You convert it into a quote
4) Customer accepts (and pays deposit if enabled)

If you’re still pricing in DMs, you’re working too hard.

Go to requests:
{{LEADS_URL}}

---

### Day 6 — Habit formation (set-and-forget)
Subject: "The habit that makes this work"
Body:
Hi {{businessName}},
BakerIQ works best when it becomes your default move:

Every pricing question → send the link.

Review pricing occasionally (only when ingredient costs change), but otherwise this is a set-and-forget system.

Copy your order page link here:
{{SHARE_URL}}

---

## Step 4 — Quality Checks
- Verify all inserted URLs resolve correctly in the app.
- Ensure businessName/variables match current templating system (use existing variables in the codebase).
- Confirm no references to “calculator” remain in customer-facing language within these onboarding emails.
- Confirm Day 4 behavior matches available branching logic (or fallback to single version).

---

## Deliverables
1) `/docs/email_sequences_v2.md` created and filled out
2) Updated Day 0–Day 6 email templates in code
3) Short summary:
   - where templates live
   - what variables are used
   - what routes were discovered and inserted
   - whether Day 4 branching was implemented or fallback was used
