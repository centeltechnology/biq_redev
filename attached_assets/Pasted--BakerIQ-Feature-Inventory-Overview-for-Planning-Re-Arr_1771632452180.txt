# BakerIQ – Feature Inventory + Overview (for Planning & Re-Arrangement)

## Goal
Create a clear, up-to-date feature overview of the current BakerIQ product so we can decide:
1) What features exist today (and where they live in the UI)
2) Which ones are core vs optional
3) How to rearrange navigation + onboarding around the “order page → request → quote → payment” flow

Do NOT implement any product changes in this task.
This is READ/ANALYZE/DOCUMENT ONLY.

## Step 1 — Scan the Codebase for Features

### A) Routes + Pages
- Enumerate all app routes (React router / Next routes / server routes).
- For each route, capture:
  - Path (e.g. `/quotes`, `/share`, `/pricing`)
  - Page/component file location
  - Visible title in UI
  - Access requirements (auth, plan gating, Stripe required, etc.)

### B) Navigation / Sidebar / Header
- Locate where the sidebar/nav items are defined.
- List each nav item:
  - Label
  - Route
  - Icon
  - Conditional visibility logic (plan, role, etc.)
  - Current order

### C) Core Feature Modules
Identify modules/features by folder or domain boundaries:
- Pricing / Price Calculator
- Public Order Page (calculator flow)
- Leads/Requests intake
- Quotes creation/sending
- Orders (if exists)
- Payments / Stripe connect & payouts
- Customers/CRM
- Share & Promote / QR / social templates / banners
- Analytics / Dashboard metrics
- Settings (profile, branding, business info)
- Referral / Affiliate (if exists)
- Admin/Super-admin (if exists)

For each module, capture:
- What it does (1–2 sentences)
- Primary user goal it supports
- Where user finds it in the UI (nav + deep links)
- Key screens (list)
- Data model tables used (if applicable)
- Dependencies (Stripe, email provider, etc.)
- Plan gating rules (Free/Basic/Pro)
- Status/quality notes (working / partially working / TODO)

## Step 2 — Produce a Downloadable Markdown Report

Create this file:
`/docs/FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md`

Include these sections:

1) **Product Summary (1 page)**
   - The core flow as implemented today
   - What the platform is optimized for (order page → request → quote → payment)

2) **Feature Map (Table)**
   Columns:
   - Feature
   - Route(s)
   - Nav Location
   - Plan Gate (Free/Basic/Pro)
   - Stripe Required? (Y/N)
   - Primary Outcome (e.g., “get inquiry”, “send quote”, “collect deposit”)
   - Notes / Risks

3) **Navigation Tree (Current)**
   - List current nav items in order

4) **Onboarding Alignment Notes**
   - Which screens support onboarding steps:
     - Setup branding
     - Review pricing
     - Share link
     - Receive request
     - Send quote
     - Connect Stripe
   - Identify gaps/misalignment

5) **Recommendations (NO CODE CHANGES)**
   - Suggest a reorganized nav order and “core vs advanced” grouping
   - Suggest which features should be surfaced earlier vs later
   - Keep this to bullets only

## Step 3 — Quick Validation Checklist
Before finalizing the report:
- Click through key flows in the dev environment (if available) OR infer from route structure
- Confirm that “Share & Promote”, “Pricing”, “Quotes”, “Leads” routes exist and match UI labels
- Confirm plan gating for Fast Quote / featured items / quote limits / platform fee tiers

## Deliverables
1) `/docs/FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md` created and filled
2) Short console summary:
   - Total routes found
   - Total nav items found
   - Any missing or dead links detected
   - Any features present in code but not in nav
