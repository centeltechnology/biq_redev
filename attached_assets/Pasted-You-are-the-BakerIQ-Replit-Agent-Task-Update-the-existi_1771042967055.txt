Task: Update the existing OPERATIONS.md operations manual by adding THREE new sections based on the current content and structure. Do NOT change existing sections unless necessary for consistency. Keep language non-technical and readable for an office manager/support staff. Use the same tone and formatting style already in OPERATIONS.md.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Edit ONLY OPERATIONS.md (no code changes).
- Preserve the existing table of contents format and add new entries for the new sections.
- Add the new sections in logical places (suggested: KPI thresholds near Financial Tracking; Authority Matrix near Escalation Guide; Founder Step-Back Plan near Daily/Weekly operations or near the end).
- Keep it practical: include clear thresholds, actions, and “who decides” rules.
- Use defaults that can be adjusted later. If a number is uncertain, choose a reasonable default and label it “Default (Adjustable)”.

NEW SECTIONS TO ADD:

1) KPI Thresholds & Health Targets
Create a section that defines “healthy / watch / critical” thresholds for key operational metrics already referenced in the manual. Include a simple table and a short “What to do if…” checklist.
Include at minimum:
- Stripe Connect Adoption Rate (% of bakers connected)
- Payment Success Rate
- Dispute/Chargeback Rate
- Support Ticket Volume (daily/weekly) and First Response Time
- Platform Uptime / Outage frequency
- Subscription churn (monthly)
- GMV trend (MoM growth/decline)
For each KPI define:
- Healthy range (Default)
- Watch range (Default)
- Critical range (Default)
- Immediate action steps + escalation rule

2) Decision Authority Matrix (Who Decides What)
Create a section that clarifies which decisions can be made by:
- Support Staff
- Operations Manager
- Founder
- Developer/Tech Lead
Format: a matrix/table with “Decision / Owner / Backup / Notes”.
Include at minimum:
- Refund approval thresholds (e.g., up to $X handled by Ops; above that Founder)
- Subscription exceptions/credits
- Quote limit resets policy
- Account suspensions/unsuspensions
- Affiliate approvals and commission disputes
- Pricing/plan changes (always Founder)
- Data export requests and legal/compliance requests (Founder)
- Outage communication (Ops drafts, Founder approves, Dev confirms)
Make sure it reduces founder dependency while still protecting the company.

3) Founder Step-Back Milestones (Reducing Founder Involvement)
Create a section that outlines milestones tied to user count (or revenue) that progressively remove the founder from day-to-day tasks. Make it a simple phased plan that aligns with the existing manual.
Example phases (use as guidance, adjust as needed):
- Phase 0 (Now): Founder involved in escalations only
- Phase 1 (1,000 users): Ops Manager owns daily checklist + support oversight
- Phase 2 (2,000 users): Founder removed from routine refunds/support; only serious escalations
- Phase 3 (3,000 users): Weekly KPI review only; Ops runs weekly checklist; founder focuses on partnerships/product direction
- Phase 4 (5,000 users): Monthly executive review; founder fully strategic
For each phase include:
- What the founder stops doing
- What the ops/dev team owns
- What reporting cadence is required (weekly/monthly)
- Escalation boundaries (what still comes to founder)

DELIVERABLE:
- Updated OPERATIONS.md with updated table of contents and the three new sections inserted cleanly.
- Keep “Last updated” note at bottom and update the month/year to the current month/year if present.

After completing the update, output ONLY the final updated OPERATIONS.md content.
