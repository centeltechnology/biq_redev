### Q: Where do I edit my order page URL?
Go to **Share → Launch Your Landing Page**. You can change your URL slug (the part after bakeriq.app/c/) and upload a header image.

### Q: What does "processing-first" mean?
You only pay a platform fee when a customer pays through your quote link. Free: 7%, Basic: 5%, Pro: 3%. All plans include unlimited quotes. No payments = no fees.

### Q: Can I redo onboarding or change my answers later?
Yes. Go to **Settings** for branding, **Pricing** for prices, and **Share → Launch Your Landing Page** for your URL and header image.

---

## Section: Your Order Page & Sharing

### What is your Order Page?
Your order page is a public link (like bakeriq.app/c/your-bakery) where customers browse your menu, see pricing, and submit a quote request. It's your online storefront — no website needed.

### Where to Find Your Link
Go to **Share**. Your order page URL is at the top — copy it with one click.

### How to Share in DMs (Facebook & Instagram)
When someone asks "how much?" in your DMs, paste your order page link. They see your menu with live pricing and can submit a request with their event details.

### What Customers See
Your branding (logo, banner, business name), cake and treat menu with prices, and any featured Express Items. They fill out event details and submit a quote request. You get the lead in **Leads** and by email.

### Q: How do Express Items work?
Go to **Pricing Calculator**, save an item, then click the star icon to feature it on your order page. Customers can order featured items with one click. Limits: Free = 1 item, Basic = 5, Pro = unlimited.

### Q: How do I customize my branding and URL?
Go to **Share → Launch Your Landing Page** to upload a header image, change your URL slug, and preview your page. Business name and logo are set in **Settings**.

### Q: Can I share individual items on social media?
Yes. Each Express Item gets its own shareable link. On the **Share** page, use the sharing buttons next to each item with pre-written captions for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, Pinterest, WhatsApp, or LinkedIn.

### Q: How do I get a QR code for my order page?
On the **Share** page, click "Download QR Code." Print it on business cards, flyers, or packaging so customers can scan and go directly to your order page.

Go to **Share**. Your link (bakeriq.app/c/your-bakery) is displayed at the top. Click "Copy" to grab it, then paste anywhere — DMs, bio, stories, or your website.

## Section: Payments Basics

### Q: Do I need Stripe to use BakerIQ?
No. You can create quotes, manage leads, and run your order page without Stripe. Stripe is only needed if you want customers to pay online through your quotes. Go to **Payments → Connect Stripe** when you're ready.

### Q: Can I set up deposits without Stripe?
Yes. Go to **Payments → Deposit Settings** to set a percentage or flat amount. Deposit amounts show on your quotes. Without Stripe, customers pay you directly (cash, Venmo, Zelle). With Stripe, they pay the deposit online.

### Q: What does connecting Stripe do?
Stripe adds a "Pay Now" button to your quotes. Customers pay deposits or full amounts through a secure checkout. Money goes to your Stripe account minus the platform fee. Track payments in **Payments**.

### Q: Why can customers accept a quote and pay later?
Accepting locks in the price and confirms the order. The customer can return to the same quote link and pay the deposit or full amount whenever they're ready. You'll see the status update in **Quotes**.

### Q: What are platform fees?
A small percentage deducted only when a customer pays through your quote link. Free: 7%, Basic ($4.99/mo): 5%, Pro ($9.99/mo): 3%. No payments through BakerIQ = no fees.

### Q: I got an email link that didn't work. What happened?
All BakerIQ links should start with bakeriq.app. If you clicked a link that went to a different address or showed a "page not found" error, the link may have been outdated. Try going directly to **bakeriq.app/help** or **bakeriq.app/login** instead.
